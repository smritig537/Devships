# Devships Project
Devships - A Friendly Platform for Developers
Overview
Devships is a unique platform designed to connect developers for collaboration, networking, and project opportunities, inspired by the swipe-based mechanics of Tinder. It enables developers to showcase their skills, match with like-minded professionals, and build meaningful professional relationships. The backend is built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, utilizing schemas for robust data management, while the frontend is developed using React with Vite for a fast and modern user experience.
Features

User Profiles: Developers can create detailed profiles highlighting their skills, experience, and preferred tech stack.
Swipe-to-Match: Swipe right to connect with other developers based on shared interests or complementary skills.
Project Collaboration: Find teammates for hackathons, open-source projects, or freelance gigs.
Real-Time Interactions: Built-in chat for seamless communication between matched developers.
Secure Authentication: JWT-based authentication ensures secure user sessions.
Scalable Architecture: MongoDB schemas enable efficient data storage and retrieval.

Tech Stack
Backend

Node.js: Server-side JavaScript runtime for scalable API development.
Express: Lightweight framework for building RESTful APIs.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for flexible and scalable data storage.
Mongoose: ODM for MongoDB to define schemas and manage data relationships.

Frontend

React: JavaScript library for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
Vite: Next-generation frontend tooling for fast development and optimized builds.
Tailwind CSS (optional, if used): Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI styling.
